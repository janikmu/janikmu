### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD student at the Chair of Information Systems for Sustainable Society, University of Cologne 🎓 

My research interest is on smart sustainable mobility and I use a mix of data and tools to gather insights of how urban mobility currently looks like and simulate what it might look like in the near future 🧩👨‍💻
